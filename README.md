## HomeEx

This project aims to analyze customer churn in HomeEx, a home-swapping platform, and identify factors that influence churn rates. The analysis will utilize two datasets: the "Exchanges" table and the "Subscriptions" table. The goal is to reduce churn rates and improve revenue and growth potential.

## Problem Statement

As the CEO of HomeEx, the company is experiencing customer churn, which is impacting revenue and growth potential. The business model relies on customers resubscribing every year to avoid being considered as churners. The objective is to analyze subscription data and user behavior to reduce churn rates during the period from 2019 to 2022.

## Data Sources

The analysis will use the following datasets:

1. "Exchanges" table: Contains conversations/exchanges initiated or received by subscribed users.
   - Purpose: To identify how user activity influences subscription renewal.
   - Note: The volume of exchanges alone is not enough to understand renewal, as different user typologies may exist.

2. "Subscriptions" table: A sample of subscriptions since 2019, including renewal information.
   - Purpose: To track subscription history and identify churn patterns.
   - Note: For users with multiple years of subscription, there will be multiple lines representing subscriptions and renewals.

## Data Collection and Preparation

The data collection and preparation steps involve the following:

- Data Collection Method: Accessing the "Exchanges" and "Subscriptions" tables using BigQuery.
- Data Cleaning Steps: Identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis will employ the following techniques:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the data to gain insights and understand the relationships between different metrics.
- Churn Analysis: Analyzing subscription data and user behavior to identify factors influencing churn rates.
  - Hypotheses for Churn Analysis:
    - Duration of conversation
    - Churn rates of churner users
    - Impact of house location on churn rates
    - Influence of sponsorship and promotional subscriptions
    - Comparison of cultural behaviors (US vs. Europe)

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis will utilize the following tools and technologies:

- Programming Language: SQL (BigQuery), Python
- Tools: Power BI for data exploration and visualization

## Timeline and Phases

The analysis will be conducted in the following phases:

1. Data exploration and understanding
2. Cleaning and transforming data
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Correlation analysis and advanced calculations
5. Visualization and dashboard creation

The duration of the analysis is estimated to be 2 weeks.

## Milestones/Phases

The project will progress through the following milestones/phases:

- Data exploration and understanding: Get familiar with the data structure and relationships.
- Cleaning and transforming data: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Exploratory data analysis: Gain insights into user behavior and churn patterns.
- Correlation analysis and advanced calculations: Analyze factors such as conversation duration, churn rates, house location, sponsorship, and cultural differences.
- Visualization and dashboard creation: Create visually appealing charts and dashboards in Power BI to communicate findings effectively.

## Success Criteria

The success of the analysis will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Identification of factors influencing churn rates in HomeEx.
- Provision of actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn and improve revenue.
- Effective communication of analysis findings through visualizations and storytelling.
